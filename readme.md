This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app). This is an example site for configuring a working contact form with NextJS and Netlify without writing any server-side code. This contact page features a contact form, a confirmation screen upon submission, enhanced spam detection and custom subject field.
